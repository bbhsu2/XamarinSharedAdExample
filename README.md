#Xamarin iOS Shared Ad Example

This is a quick example of how to create a single ad for your apps
using Monotouch.iAd.  The ad is put on the RootViewController in the app delegate
and a custom ad takes care of the display logic for you.  `ViewControllers will need to override `ViewWillLayoutSubviews

This also demonstrates another way pushing `ViewControllers with navigation.  The interface is code-only, so no XIB's here.

##Enjoy!
